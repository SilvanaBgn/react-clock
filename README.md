# Summary

This is a React project, created with create-react-app (CRA), that shows 2 clocks: 
1) One created with a class and using setState(), 
2) And the other built with hooks (useState and useEffect)

Developed with React v17 (2021).

# Motivation

I wanted to create a tiny easy static React page, to compare Class lifecycle vs Hooks. So this clock idea was born.

# Developer mode

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start` script

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm run build` script

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## `npm run deploy` script

After running a `npm run build`, this command deploys the running app into [https://silvanabgn.github.io/react-clock/](https://silvanabgn.github.io/react-clock/)
